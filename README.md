## Problem Statement
Our aim is to understand and estimate the range of co2 emissions from different types of vehicles using numerical and categorical variables from the dataset as predictors.

## Motivation
In recent years, climate change has become a pressing issue, with vehicle emissions playing a significant role in air pollution. Our project therefore, aims to explore the key factors that impact the release of CO2 emissions from vehicles, paving the way for a cleaner environment.


## Content 
- Sample Collection
- Data Cleaning
- Data Analysis
- Exploratory Analysis and Visualization
- Machine Learning Models

## Machine Learning Models Used
- GBM Model
- SVM Model
- Logistic Regression Model
- Neural network

## Conclusions
We can understand the important factors that affect the amount of co2 emissions based on the dataset using different machine learning models.

This can help in reducing carbon footprint in the following ways:

  - The government can implement the right restrictions and policies by understanding how Co2 emissions vary based on the vehicle's attributes, both internal and external.
  - Vehicle industries can modify certain factors involving its engineering and manufacturing.
  - The public can be educated on the magnitude of CO2 emissions and make the right choices while purchasing vehicles.


## What did we learn from this project?
- Learning about how the various machine learning models work
- Challenging to implement the code for the models efficiently
- As expected the engine displacement was directly proportional to the Co2 emissions
- The GBM predicted the range of Co2 that was emitted by vehicles for each predictor variable
- The Neural Network gave a brief understanding of how the predicted and actual Co2 emissions varied but had a lower predicting accuracy
